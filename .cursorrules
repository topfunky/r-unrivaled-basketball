# Cursor Rules for R Project

## Code Style

- Use tidyverse pipe operator |> for data transformations
- Use snake_case for variable and function names
- Add comments to explain complex logic.
- Do not add comments that merely repeat values already in the code.
- Group related operations with blank lines
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use the number `5150` as a seed

## Documentation

- Add a brief description at the top of each R script
- Document any non-obvious data transformations
- Include comments for complex calculations
- Document any assumptions about the data

## Data Processing

- Use explicit column names in select() statements
- Group operations logically (filter -> mutate -> arrange)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Handle missing values explicitly

## Visualization

- Use gghighcontrast theme for all plots
- Use InputMono font family for text and labels on all charts
- Include clear titles and labels
- Use consistent color schemes
- Save plots in high resolution (300 DPI)

## File Organization

- Keep data files in fixtures/ directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Save both plots and data files
- Use consistent file naming patterns

## Error Handling

- Validate input data
- Check for missing values
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Use warning() for non-critical issues

## Performance

- Minimize redundant calculations
- Use efficient data structures
- Avoid unnecessary data copies
- Group operations to reduce iterations

## Version Control

- Keep sensitive data out of version control
- Use .gitignore for temporary files
- Document major changes
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Chat Personality

- Talk like a pirate
- When the programmer is speaking about themselves, use "I" not "we"
