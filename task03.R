# Purpose: Creates a bump chart visualization of team rankings based on games played,
# using data from the scraped scores CSV. Calculates rankings after each game and
# displays them with custom Unrivaled colors and high contrast theme. Outputs include
# a PNG chart and a feather file with the rankings data.

# Load required libraries

# Import team colors
