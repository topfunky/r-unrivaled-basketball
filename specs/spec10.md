# Task 10: calculate other metrics

## Metrics using play by play data

Using existing feather files with play by play data and box score data, calculate the following using R.

- Count the number of free throw attempts by all teams in all games
- Count the number of free throw attempts that resulted in a change of possession. The ball does not change possession if a free throw is immediately followed by an offensive rebound.
- Calculate the percentage of free throw attempts that resulted in a change of possession.
- Calculate the average points per possession across all games.
- Calculate each player's field goal percentage. Create a density plot from this data.
- Calculate each player's true shooting percentage. Create a density plot from this data.

Print all of these metrics to a table using Markdown format.
