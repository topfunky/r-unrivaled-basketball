# Task 10: Calculate various basketball metrics from play-by-play
# and box score data. This script calculates free throw attempts,
# possession changes, points per possession,
# and shooting percentages for players using both
# play-by-play and box score data.
#
# Also uses WNBA stats from task11.R to compare against.
